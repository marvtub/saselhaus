Boost your Elementor with some fresh and yet innovative options.

== Description ==

An awesome set of tools, options and settings that expand Elementor defaults. Instead of creating new Elementor Widgets, these act like an upgrade of existing options or the self-standing panels thing. 

= What is new? =

Since the version 1.7.2 IMBOX and ICOBOX extensions bring the new responsive controls for the image/icon size, while the existing Override controls now include new 'vw' and 'vh' CSS units. 

From now on BREAKING BAD allows you to set the Column-link (clickable column).

The new extension is here! PSEUDO allows you to add and manage so called pseudo elements (:before and :after) of any Column. The functionality is almost identical to already existing PoopArt extension. 
With over 20 controls, CSS effects, masking option, and clip-path per pseudo-element, it literally feels like you have 2 additional Background Overlay elements. You can find a new control panel under the "Advanced" tab of any Column - including the Inner Section's columns.

= In the package so far =

1. HARAKIRI 
Allows you to change the writing mode (CSS property writing-mode) of Elementor's Heading and Text Editor widgets.

2. POOPART
Add an overlay or underlay ghost-element to any Elementor Widget. By adding a mask image to these, and/or combining them with CSS filters, blend mode, a wow effect is inevitable. Oh, yes, you can also resize and reposition these if you like.

3. OVERLAIZ
From now on, you can move the Background Overlay in any direction, as well as to resize it. Creating overlapping columns is now piece of cake.

4. PAGININI
Your frustration with styling up the posts pagination in Elementor is now officially over.

5. BREAKING BAD
Tailor the Section columns at will! Set the custom width, height and let them collapse naturally.

6. GLIDER
Generate the slider out of Section and columns with one click only!

7. PHOTOGIRAFFE
Make any Image full-height

8. TELEPORTER
An awesome Coulmn hover controls

9. SEARCH COP
Decide what to search for; posts only, pages only or everything.

10. VIDEOMASQ
Add the SVG mask to the Section video background and let the video play inside any shape

11. BASELINE GRID
Find it uder the Page Settings! It allows you to define the visual grid and thus ensure consistent vertical spacing with your typography and page elements.

12. BUTTER BUTTON
From now on you can design awesome buttons in Elementor! Forget about those flat, boring and outdated buttons style, Butter Button brings fun! 

13. PERSPEKTIVE
A small set of options that allow you to move widgets in 3D space

14. SHADOUGH
This extension allows you to create the shadow that conforms the shape.

15. PHOTOMORPH
From now on you can add the clip-path to the Image widget for Normal and Hover state.

16. COMMENTZ
Style up your Post Comments from Elementor.

17. SPACERAT
Adds new shine to the Spacer widget.

18. IMBOX
More controls to the Image Box widget.

19. HOVERANIMATOR
Animate widgets on column's mouse-over event

20. KONTROLZ
Allows you to additionaly style Image Carousel and Media Carousel controls.

21. WIDGET STALKER
Stack widgets one after another inside the column.

22. ICOBOX
More controls to the Icon Box widget.

23. PSEUDO
Add and manage Column's pseudo elements. It's a PoopArt for Columns!

24. MORE IS COMING SOON!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use OoohBoi Steroids? =

It depends on the widgets that you are editing. For example, if you are about to style Heading widget or Text Editor widget, HARAKIRI options will show up.
All the POOPART options can be found under "Advanced" tab, POOPART panel.
Rest assured, you won't miss them because there will always be an eye-catching icon next to the set of options (or the panel title).

= Do I need Elementor PRO with this add-on? =

No, you don't. It'll work with both free version of Elementor and Elementor PRO.
